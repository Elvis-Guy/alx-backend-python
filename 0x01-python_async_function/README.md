# Python - Async

This project aims to provide an introduction to asynchronous programming in Python using the `async` and `await` syntax. It covers topics such as executing async programs with `asyncio`, running concurrent coroutines, creating asyncio tasks, and utilizing the `random` module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external resources:

1. `async` and `await` syntax: Understand how to define and work with asynchronous functions and await the results of other coroutines.
2. Executing an async program with `asyncio`: Learn how to run an asynchronous program using the `asyncio` library.
3. Running concurrent coroutines: Explore techniques for running multiple coroutines concurrently to improve performance.
4. Creating asyncio tasks: Understand how to create tasks in `asyncio` to manage and schedule coroutines.
5. Using the random module: Learn how to utilize the `random` module for generating random numbers and selecting random elements.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this project, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming and familiarity with functions and modules.

## Getting Started

Follow the prompts and observe the output to understand how async programming works in Python.
