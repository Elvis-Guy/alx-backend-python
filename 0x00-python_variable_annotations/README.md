# Python - Variable Annotations

This project focuses on understanding and implementing variable annotations in Python. It covers type annotations in Python 3, utilizing them to specify function signatures and variable types, exploring the concept of duck typing, and validating code using the mypy tool.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain type annotations in Python 3 and their significance in the language.
- Understand how to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types accurately.
- Gain knowledge about the concept of duck typing and its relevance in Python.
- Validate your code using the mypy tool to ensure type consistency and catch potential errors.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/variable-annotations.git`
2. Change to the project directory: `cd variable-annotations`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can use this project to:

- Explore examples and explanations of type annotations in Python 3.
- Understand how to annotate function signatures and variable types effectively.
- Learn about duck typing and its application in Python programming.
- Practice validating your code using the mypy tool.

## Examples

The `examples` directory in this project contains various Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of variable annotations. You can run these scripts to see the annotations in action and observe the effects they have on the code.

## Resources

Here are some resources that can help you further understand variable annotations in Python:
